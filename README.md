## *IonTracks* calculations
Features the calculation of recombination losses in ion, electron, and photon beams in parallel-plate gas-filled ionization chambers: 
- Ion beams exhibit a non-uniform charge carrier distribution which is accounted for through amorphous track structure theory.
Use the "IonBeams" scripts for ions.

- Photon and electron beams are associated with uniform charge carrier densities. The current scripts enable the inclusion of electric fields varying in both time and space in constrast to theories.


## Validation 
#### Ion beams:
The *IonTracks* code is partially validated in    
Christensen, Jeppe Brage, Heikki TÃ¶lli, and Niels Bassler (2016) A general algorithm for calculation of recombination losses in ionization chambers exposed to ion beams *Medical Physics* 43.__10__: 5484-92

#### Photon and electron beams:
*IonTracks* is validated against the Boag theory (the basis of the Two-voltage method) for photon and electron beams with uniform charge carrier densities 

## Calculation of recombination losses
Both the IonBeams folder and the electron/photon folder feature example files.


## Dependencies and installation
